## How to use
1. **Create at least ONE Style**. The Style menus are the worst UX I've seen in my life, but I know that in browser, you go to "Create & edit styles" -> "Create custom style" -> "Describe style instead" -> "Use custom instructions (advanced)". The Styles are as follows:
    - **Standard** - Designed for ET off. Has some "fake thinking" to improve jailbreak strength and response quality. Generally the most stable style.
    - **Zero Thinking** - ET off. Has no fake thinking at start. Less stable.
    - **ET** - Full stepped thinking process. Quite stable.
    - **ET Short** - This is for people who want to use Opus ET, as Opus ET's responses get interrupted after some period of time if the injection occurs. The shorter thinking process gives Opus more time to write before interruption. A little less stable but Opus is easier, should cancel out.

**If you ever get stuck/refused**, you can retry with a different Style (remember to flip ET when appropriate). Even a less stable style can luck out, it's more art than science. Or edit and reword, etc. - whatever you do, don't leave a refusal up.

2. (Subscribers) **Use the Instructions as project instructions**. Create a Project, put whatever name/description, click "Create project." Click "Set project instructions" and paste the text of the Instructions

2. (Free users) **Send the Instructions as a prompt**. With **Standard** Style active, paste the prompt in chat. Feel free to include your first message with the prompt. It can be a simple "hi," it can be request for a sex scene, whatever you want.

For the above, if you make changes and add too much to the Instructions, it'll transform into a file upload when you paste. This will not work:

You'll have to edit an already started conversation's first message and paste - this avoids the file conversion.

## Customization tips
- Generally, you can add your own instructions to each Mindspace.
- The most effective place to add customization is probably inside the Style - edit steps, add your own steps (glance over the rest of the Style to make sure the rest of it still makes sense).
