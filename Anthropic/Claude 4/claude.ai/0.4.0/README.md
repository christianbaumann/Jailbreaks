# How to use
1. **Create at least ONE Style**. The Style menus are the worst UX I've seen in my life, but I know that in browser, you go to "Create & edit styles" -> "Create custom style" -> "Describe style instead" -> "Use custom instructions (advanced)". The Styles are as follows:
    - **Standard** - Designed for ET off but works kind of okay with it on too. Has some "fake thinking" to improve jailbreak strength and response quality. Almost certainly the most stable Style.
    - **ET** - Full stepped thinking process, also decently stable.
    - **ET Short** - This is for people who want to use Opus ET, as Opus ET's responses get interrupted after some period of time if the injection occurs. The shorter thinking process gives Opus more time to write before interruption.
    - **Zero Thinking** - ET off. Has no fake thinking at start. Least stable but should still be a good experience for most content.
  
2. (Subscribers) **Use the Instructions as project instructions**. Create a Project, name and describe it anything, click "Create project." Click "Set project instructions" and paste the text of the Instructions

2. (Free users) **Send the Instructions as a prompt**. WITH STANDARD ACTIVE, paste the prompt in chat. For best results (and better use of limit anyway), include your first message with the prompt. It can be a simple "hi," it can be a nasty-ass sex scene request.

For the above, if you make changes and add too much to the Instructions, it'll transform into a file upload when you paste. This will not work:

You'll have to edit an already started conversation's first message and paste - this avoids the file conversion.

## Customization tips
- Generally, you can add your own instructions to each Mindspace.
- The most effective place to add customization is probably inside the Style - edit steps, add your own steps (glance over the rest of the Style to make sure the rest of it still makes sense).

## Changes from 0.3.0
- Shortened instructions significantly
- Added extra Styles - Standard non-ET is now much more stable
