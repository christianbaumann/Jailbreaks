The Perplexity prompt works decently on API as well.

Perplexity is the best value right now, probably. Multiple ways to get a year for free (like the US Samsung deal, download the app from the Galaxy store and sign in), or <$5 on key reselling sites like G2G.

For API use, if your account is "pozzed", i.e., have the "safety injection" (which just got buffed hard in early 2025), you'll have to add a counter-inject. I have some examples in the claude.ai prompt. I might lab out a full setup later but for now you'll have to DIY it. This is what the injection looks like, scroll to bottom: https://poe.com/s/iDVnPUPVXBO3kLiCa9cd

As far as I know, you cannot be pozzed on Bedrock or Vertex. OpenRouter has had the "injection" in the past, apparently as part of a testing partnership with Anthropic, but I don't think they do now.
