## Info
DeepSeek can be used for free on OpenRouter and should otherwise be used from API or another service, not the Deepseek website. OpenRouter has a generous free allowance while official web has external censorship issues.

I think Deepseek R1 has INCREDIBLE potential. It doesn't need much jailbreaking, just a guiding hand to keep its... "creativity" under control. I'd like to revisit one of these days and spend an afternoon reigning it in. But for now, [one of my recent Gemini jailbreaks works well](https://github.com/horselock/Jailbreaks/blob/main/Gemini/2.5/Pyrite%203%20Beta%20(Flash%20on%20web%20or%20app)). That's for thinking models, so R1 and likely eventually R2; you can probably use the "Short" jailbreak [from my Gemini](https://github.com/horselock/Jailbreaks/tree/main/Gemini/2.5) section for V3.
