## Info
Grok is pretty lightly censored. I haven't made anything specific for it yet. My most recent Gemini jailbreaks seem to work well on other models.
[For Grok 4 which is thinking only](https://github.com/horselock/Jailbreaks/blob/main/Gemini/2.5/Pyrite%203%20Beta%20(Flash%20on%20web%20or%20app)), and for older non-thinking models like 2 and 3, the "Short" jailbreak [from my Gemini](https://github.com/horselock/Jailbreaks/tree/main/Gemini/2.5) does fine.
