This GPT got killed within a week, I've put it up again with a "stealthier" name, let's see how it pans out.

["Mild" (lol) Writer 2025-7-4](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6876add340ec8191a9fae599d8892e45-mild-lol-writer-2025-7-4-reupload-2)

## File order
I have not tested all file orders, but I know that upload order matters slightly, and the order I'm using is:

1. smut guideline 5.txt
2. Examples and notes.txt
3. Override Tool rephrase.txt

## Tips
"/rephrase" tool automatically reduces refusals, ideally seamelessly without it saying anything.

Sometimes you might have to call /rephrase yourself, either edited onto the end of your request or as a follow-up. Follow-ups leaving the refusal up are not recommend, though sometimes they are stronger in the moment.

Getting clever/creative with wording like "oh excuse me, /rephrase ;)" is usually even stronger.
